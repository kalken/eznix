eznix-terminal — one shell for one user, served as a WebSocket.

  eznix-terminal --port 9091 --key-file /run/eznix-terminal/alice/key --dir /etc/nixos

Runs as the person whose shell it is, never as eznix itself: eznix.py may be an unprivileged
service account, and could not start a shell as somebody else. One of these per user who has a
terminal (or exactly one, started by eznix.py itself, when eznix is run by hand).

Always binds 127.0.0.1 -- the browser never connects here. eznix.py relays /terminal to this
process over loopback (see _proxy_terminal() there), so the browser only ever needs to trust
one address and one certificate, and this leg never leaves the machine. Requests are accepted
only with the secret in --key-file, which only eznix.py and this user can read.

The shell session always survives a dropped/closed WebSocket connection (browser closed, network
blip, logout) -- see _SESSION, _create_session(), _session_reader() below. There is only ever one
session, shared by every connection regardless of who or what browser it comes from -- see
_SESSION's own comment for why. Reconnecting reattaches to the same still-running shell,
repainting a snapshot of its current screen content (see _VirtualScreen below) rather than
replaying its raw output history, instead of forking a fresh one; the shell itself only ever dies
when it exits on its own, or when this whole process does (a reboot, a manual restart of
eznix-terminal.service, which kills every process in its cgroup including anything the shell
spawned -- systemd's own default KillMode, not anything this file does) -- nothing here can make
it survive that. This used to be a `terminal_persist` toggle (off by default, matching the
original pre-persistence behavior of killing the shell the moment its one connection ended) --
removed once it became clear the "kill on disconnect" path was the one actually causing problems:
a foreground job (htop, say) running when the browser tab reloaded got orphaned, since only the
shell itself was ever signaled, not what it had spawned. Simpler to just always persist and let
that whole failure mode not exist, than to also chase down killing an entire job tree correctly.

# thing for the terminal that is installed and configured now (_terminal_for() there, the same

# rebuild never restarts a terminal by itself -- see restartIfChanged in the NixOS module.

# _SESSION holds the one shell that's still running, or None -- independent of any particular
# WebSocket connection, which is the whole point: it outlives a client detaching (browser closed,
# network drop, logout) and is only ever cleared by _session_reader() once the shell itself
# actually exits. There's only ever this one session, shared by every connection regardless of who
# or what browser it comes from -- there's no per-browser identity anywhere else in eznix either
# (one shared login for everyone with access, see check_auth() in eznix.py), so a per-browser
# terminal would be the only thing in the whole app pretending otherwise. It's also simpler, and
# has no failure mode a per-browser id (tried first, then reverted) did: clearing cookies/site
# data (which usually wipes localStorage too, where a per-browser id would live) would silently
# orphan that browser's still-running shell forever, unreachable by anything, with no cleanup
# mechanism -- there's no id here to lose in the first place. The trade-off is explicit: anyone
# who can log in shares this exact one terminal, always, not just multiple tabs of one browser.
# _SESSION_LOCK guards setting/clearing/checking _SESSION itself; the session also has its own
# 'lock' guarding that session's mutable state (vscreen/writers/rows/cols) -- two separate locks so
# the session's I/O never blocks a connect/disconnect deciding whether to (re)create it.
#
# One thing this file can't prevent at the source: a shell prompt framework that queries the
# terminal at startup (background colour via OSC 11, device attributes via DA1, DECRQM mode
# queries, ...) can end up with xterm.js's automatic answer landing as literal typed input sitting
# unsubmitted in the shell's own line editor, if the shell wasn't still synchronously listening for
# it by the time the answer got back over the WebSocket round-trip. That's real, live state in the
# shell's own input buffer, not anything this file holds -- _VirtualScreen's snapshot reproduces it
# faithfully (correctly, since it's genuinely what's on screen), but the *live* shell can still
# redraw it a second time on top of a correct snapshot if something forces a SIGWINCH afterward --
# see the resize handling's own comment for why that's avoided for a plain shell prompt.

# _VirtualScreen -- a small, dependency-free terminal emulator that tracks just enough screen
# state (a grid of cells, each with its own colour/attributes, plus cursor position) to paint an
# exact, safe snapshot for a reattaching client, in place of replaying the session's raw output
# history. Earlier versions tried exactly that (a bounded ring of recent bytes, replayed
# outright), and every attempt to make raw replay safe kept running into the same root problem: a
# byte stream that was only ever meant to be interpreted once, live, isn't safe to interpret a
# second time out of context -- it corrupts a full-screen curses app's cursor/screen tracking
# (replaying a differential-update stream with no full paint underneath), and separately, any
# terminal-capability query in it (OSC 10/11 colour, DA1, DECRQM, ...) gets answered a second time
# by a fresh xterm.js instance that can't tell replay from live traffic, landing back in the shell
# as visible garbage. Feeding that same stream through this class instead and sending only the
# *result* -- the resolved screen content, not the escape sequences that produced it -- sidesteps
# both: a full repaint of the current grid needs no prior state to make sense of, and a query never
# reaches the reattaching client's xterm.js at all, since it's parsed and discarded here rather
# than reproduced.
#
# Deliberately not a complete VT100/xterm implementation -- just the escape sequences real shells
# and full-screen apps actually rely on for screen *content* (cursor movement, erase, scrolling,
# SGR colour/attributes, the alternate screen buffer). Anything else (title changes, charset
# switching, ...) is safely ignored rather than mis-rendered, and an unrecognized sequence is
# skipped rather than risking getting the parser permanently out of sync with the stream. Query/
# status sequences (DA1/DA2 `c`, DSR `n`, DECRQM `$p`) are recognized and dropped with no effect --
# correct, since there's no live client attached to answer them at parse time anyway, and it would
# be wrong to answer them even if there were.
